Bugs

* After exiting (:q) a buffer that has diff enabled, subsequent diffs appear to fail.
* Should restore options like 'wrap' to their original state when turning diff off
* winsaveview() and winrestview() require Vim 7.x. Autodetect and degrade gracefully.

Features

* Autodetect type of scm (by file/dir existence? or by trying to execute an scm command?
* Option to show side-by-side diff (ie. don't hide original buffer)
